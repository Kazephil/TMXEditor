            <p>Most CAT (Computer Aided Translation) tools rely on TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) 
                standard to exchange translation memory data. Unfortunately, some tools produce files 
                that are not valid and others do not accept TMX documents that are correctly formatted.</p>
            <p>TMXEditor checks the validity of TMX files against TMX DTD and also verifies if 
                they follow the requirements described in TMX specifications.</p>
